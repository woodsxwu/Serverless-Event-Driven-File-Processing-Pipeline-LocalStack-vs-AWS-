# Copy this to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed

# Required: Deployment environment
environment = "localstack"  # or "aws"

# Optional: Override defaults
# project_name   = "my-custom-name"
# aws_region     = "us-west-2"

# For AWS deployments using SSO/IAM Identity Center:
# 1. Configure your SSO profile: aws configure sso
# 2. Login before deployment: aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
# 3. Set profile: export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>
# Terraform will automatically create necessary IAM roles
